# Sloan Digital Sky Survey Classification
### Time of Project: Spring 2019
### Independent Study Project
### Bachelors of Science in Statistics, Texas A&M University

For this project, data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey was used to test various classification methods to classify objects as stars, galaxies, or quasars and identify the best model. The main data points were an observation's reponse values from the five optical filters using the Thuan-Gunn Star Magnitude System (u, g, r, i, z), and the objectâ€™s redshift. Statistical models used in this analysis are Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Basic Trees, and Random Forest.
